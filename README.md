JS13K-Invertagon
======================

Game entry for the [JS13K Game challenge](http://js13kgames.com/)

# Invertagon #
Invertagon is a puzzle game, where the player needs to invert the colours on the board back to the primary (Red, Green or Blue) colours. This is done by placing different inverters on the board. These inverters influence primary and secondary colours, as well as each other.

The theme was reversed and I decided to take a spin on that and go for inversing colours.

# Controls #
The game is played with the mouse only.
